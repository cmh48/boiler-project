# Tutorial

Step 1) To begin, install WebStorm onto your computer by going to https://git-scm.com/download/mac for macs and https://git-scm.com/download/win for windows.

- **WebStorm is an IDE (_a software that was built to hold the necessary basic tools to write and test software_) that gives users
coding assistance for JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, enhancing productivity.**

Step 2) After installment is complete create an account.

Step 3) Head over to https://github.com and create an account here as well.

- The creation of both these accounts help in collaborating and connecting projects between you and your partner, and others.

Step 4) Create a repository by clicking on the "__+__" symbol located on the top right corner of your github screen.
- a `repository` is a place to store and share projects.
- when creating a repository you have the option to initialize a README file and add a .gitignore (.gitignore file that helps determine which files and directories to ignore in the project)

Step 5) Once your repository is created, add any collaborators onto your project by going into the setting tab, under collaborators.
Here is where you can search and add people onto your project.

Step 6) Once you have setup your repository and added any collaborators to the project. Launch the WebStorm IDE.

Step 7) With WebStorm opened, on the first page you will see different options such as creating a new project. Because you
have set up a project in GitHub you may `clone` that project into WebStorm using the "Check Out from Version Control", "Git" function.
